# Cryptic Expo CLI Build Failure

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI produces a cryptic build failure due to a conflict with a custom project configuration. The issue is difficult to diagnose because the error message lacks specific details.  This example focuses on resolving a conflict that could occur with native modules or unusual asset handling.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`. Observe the cryptic build error.
4. Examine `expoBugSolution.js` for a possible solution. 

## Solution

The provided solution file (`expoBugSolution.js`) outlines strategies to resolve such build errors.  This involves carefully reviewing the Expo CLI logs, examining the project's configuration files (e.g., `app.json`, `package.json`, `metro.config.js`), and possibly isolating problematic dependencies or custom build steps. The approach involves identifying the root cause by systematic elimination and adjusting the project configuration to resolve incompatibilities with the Expo CLI.
