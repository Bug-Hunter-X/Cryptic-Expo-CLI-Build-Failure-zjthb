This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that uses a custom build process or has unusual dependencies. The error message itself is often cryptic and doesn't provide much information about the root cause.  It might manifest as a general build failure or an unexpected crash during the Expo prebuild process.  This is usually caused by a conflict between the Expo CLI's build process and a custom configuration or package.  For example, problems may arise with native modules, Webpack configurations, or unusual asset handling.   Debugging this requires careful examination of the logs and the project's configuration files to find the source of the conflict.
