The solution involves systematic debugging. Here's a breakdown of strategies:

1. **Examine Expo Logs:** Carefully analyze the complete Expo CLI output (including warnings). Look for specific error messages that are nested deep within other messages. Often, the root cause is hidden within lengthy log streams.

2. **Simplify the Project:**  Temporarily remove or comment out custom configurations, non-essential dependencies, and native modules one by one. Rebuild the project after each removal to pinpoint the problematic component.

3. **Check Dependencies:** Review your `package.json` file, ensuring all dependencies are compatible with Expo's current version. Update or remove potentially conflicting packages.  Pay close attention to native modules; conflicts frequently occur here. 

4. **Review Metro Config (metro.config.js):**  If you have a custom `metro.config.js`, double-check for any misconfigurations or settings that may interfere with Expo's build process. 

5. **Isolate the Problem:** Create a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the issue. This will help you isolate the exact cause and create a more concise bug report if you need to seek external assistance. 

6. **Clean and Rebuild:** Always try cleaning your project's cache and doing a fresh build using `expo prebuild --clean` before attempting other fixes.
